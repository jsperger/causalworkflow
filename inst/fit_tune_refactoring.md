# Name Changes
Use `component` instead of `nuisance`. The doc strings may still refer to nuisance components but depending on the model being specified the outcome or weight models may not be nuisances.

Use `weight`, `weight_spec`, etc. instead of propensity, `pspec`, etc. 

# Refactor fitting functions
