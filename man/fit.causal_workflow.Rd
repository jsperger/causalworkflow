\usage{
\method{fit}{causal_workflow}(object, data, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{causal_workflow} object that has been configured with
a propensity model and an outcome model.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the training data, including the
treatment, outcome, and covariate variables.}

\item{...}{Not used.}
}
\value{
A \code{fitted_causal_workflow} object. This object contains:
\itemize{
\item \code{propensity_model_fit}, \code{outcome_model_fit}: The nuisance models
fitted on the full dataset.
\item \code{treatment_levels}: A character vector of the treatment levels.
\item \code{estimates}: A tibble with the estimated potential outcome for each
treatment level.
\item \code{variances}: A tibble with the variance of the potential outcome
estimator for each level.
\item \code{eif_pom}: A tibble of the observation-level efficient influence function
(EIF) values for the POM, with one column for each treatment level.
\item \code{nuisance_predictions}: A tibble of the in-sample nuisance
predictions.
}

\description{
\code{fit} for a \code{causal_workflow} object performs a straightforward,
non-cross-fitted estimation of causal effects. It fits the propensity and
outcome models on the full dataset and uses in-sample predictions to
construct the efficient influence function (EIF) for the potential outcome
mean (POM).

This method is best suited for simple, non-regularized models (e.g.,
unpenalized logistic or linear regression) where the risk of overfitting is
low. For more complex or regularized models, using in-sample predictions can
lead to biased estimates. In those cases, it is strongly recommended to use
\code{\link[=fit_across]{fit_across()}} for cross-fitted estimation or \code{\link[=tune_nested]{tune_nested()}} for
estimation with hyperparameter tuning.

The method calculates the EIF for the Potential Outcome Mean (POM) for each
treatment level. The POM is the average outcome that would be observed if all
individuals in the population received a specific treatment.
