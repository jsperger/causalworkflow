\title{Fit a causal workflow}
\usage{
\method{fit}{causal_workflow}(object, data, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{causal_workflow} object that has been configured with
a propensity model and an outcome model.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the training data, including the
treatment, outcome, and covariate variables.}

\item{...}{Not used.}
}
\value{
A \code{fitted_causal_workflow} object. This object contains:
\itemize{
\item \code{propensity_model_fit}, \code{outcome_model_fit}: The final nuisance models
fitted on the full dataset.
\item \code{treatment_levels}: A character vector of the treatment levels.
\item \code{estimates}: A tibble with the estimated potential outcome for each
treatment level.
\item \code{variances}: A tibble with the variance of the potential outcome
estimator for each level.
\item \code{eif}: A tibble of the observation-level efficient influence function
(EIF) values, with one column for each treatment level.
\item \code{nuisance_predictions}: A tibble of the out-of-sample nuisance
predictions from the cross-fitting procedure.
}
}
\description{
\code{fit()} for a \code{causal_workflow} object performs a cross-fitted estimation
of causal effects. It supports both binary and categorical treatments.
It uses out-of-sample predictions for the nuisance models (propensity and
outcome models) to construct the efficient influence function for each
treatment level, providing robust estimates of potential outcomes.
