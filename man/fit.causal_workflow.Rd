\title{Fit a causal workflow}
\usage{
\method{fit}{causal_workflow}(object, data, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{causal_workflow} object that has been configured with
a propensity model and an outcome model.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the training data, including the
treatment, outcome, and covariate variables.}

\item{...}{Not used.}
}
\value{
A \code{fitted_causal_workflow} object. This object contains the
fitted nuisance models (trained on the full dataset), the final point
estimate and its variance, the observation-level efficient influence
function values, and the out-of-sample nuisance predictions.
}
\description{
\code{fit()} for a \code{causal_workflow} object performs a cross-fitted estimation
of the specified causal effect (e.g., ATE). It uses out-of-sample
predictions for the nuisance models (propensity and outcome models) to
construct the efficient influence function, providing a robust estimate.
