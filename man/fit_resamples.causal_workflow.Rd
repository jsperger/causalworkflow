\title{Resample a causal workflow}
\usage{
\method{fit_resamples}{causal_workflow}(
  object,
  resamples,
  metrics = NULL,
  control = tune::control_resamples()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{causal_workflow} object.}

\item{resamples}{An \code{rsample} object, such as one created by
\code{\link[rsample:vfold_cv]{rsample::vfold_cv()}}.}

\item{metrics}{A \code{\link[yardstick:metric_set]{yardstick::metric_set()}} containing the metrics to
compute for each model. If \code{NULL} (the default), standard metrics are
chosen based on the model mode. Note: The same metrics will be applied to
both models, so they must be compatible. For more specific control, use
the \code{control} argument.}

\item{control}{A \code{\link[tune:control_grid]{tune::control_resamples()}} object from the \code{tune} package used
to manage the resampling process.}
}
\value{
A resamples object with a \code{.metrics} column containing the performance
metrics for both the propensity and outcome models. The \code{.nuisance_component}
column in the metrics tibble distinguishes between \code{"propensity_model"}
and \code{"outcome_model"}.
}
\description{
\code{\link[=fit_resamples]{fit_resamples()}} for a \code{causal_workflow} object evaluates the performance
of the two nuisance models (propensity and outcome) across a set of
resamples. It provides metrics to diagnose model performance, which is
crucial for the validity of the final causal estimates.
}
\details{
For each resample, this function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Fits the propensity score model on the analysis set.
\item Generates predictions on the assessment set and calculates performance
metrics (e.g., \code{\link[yardstick:roc_auc]{yardstick::roc_auc()}} for binary classification).
\item Fits the outcome model on the analysis set.
\item Generates predictions on the assessment set and calculates performance
metrics (e.g., \code{\link[yardstick:rmse]{yardstick::rmse()}} for regression).
}

The resulting metrics are collected into a single tibble, with columns
identifying which model component each metric corresponds to. This allows
for a comprehensive assessment of the nuisance models before proceeding to
causal effect estimation.
