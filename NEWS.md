# CausalWorkflows 0.1.0

* Initial release of `CausalWorkflows`.
* This package provides a framework for estimating causal effects using multi-stage, modular modeling procedures.
* Core functionality includes `causal_workflow()` and `staged_workflow()` for specifying and fitting causal models.
* The package is a refactoring of the `stacks` package, with all model stacking functionality removed to focus on causal inference.
